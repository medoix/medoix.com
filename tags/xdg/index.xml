This usually means something has gone haywire with your configuration and the desktop is now set to a different folder (different than the default /home/user/Desktop folder).
This happened to me and i believe it was because i deleted my Desktop folder (don&amp;rsquo;t ask) and it seems that XDG just took it upon itself to set its new location to my home (~/) directory and therefore i was seeing dot files and all the different folders associated.</description></item></channel></rss>
