As you can imagine copying one section at a time from your favourite text editor has long been a pain in the rear end.
The trick uses netcat (nc) to pipe text over an SSH connection to a local listener that passes it to pbcopy.</description></item><item><title>Make Sudo Sessions Last Longer in Linux</title><link>https://medoix.com/posts/2013/08/make-sudo-sessions-last-longer-in-linux/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Aug 2013 08:52:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://medoix.com/posts/2013/08/make-sudo-sessions-last-longer-in-linux/</guid><description>When you run sudo in Ubuntu, your administrative privileges last for 15 minutes by default so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to type in your password with every command. If that is too long or short for your tastes, you can change it with a simple tweak.
Run the following command in a Terminal:
sudo visudo Scroll down to the line that looks like this:
Defaults env_reset and change it to this:</description></item><item><title>Make Password Asterisks Visible in your Mac or Linux Terminal</title><link>https://medoix.com/posts/2013/08/make-password-asterisks-visible-in-your-mac-or-linux-terminal/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Aug 2013 08:41:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://medoix.com/posts/2013/08/make-password-asterisks-visible-in-your-mac-or-linux-terminal/</guid><description>When you run a command with sudo in Linux, the terminal prompts you to type in your password and doesn&amp;rsquo;t give you any visual feedback. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick tweak that&amp;rsquo;ll bring back those familiar asterisks (*) when you type in your password.
I&amp;rsquo;m a fast typer, so when I mess up my password, I have to start over from scratch. With asterisks, it&amp;rsquo;s a lot easier—and seeing as no one&amp;rsquo;s looking over my shoulder in my home office, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter how obscured my password is.</description></item><item><title>Stop OS X Terminal SSH Timeout</title><link>https://medoix.com/posts/2012/02/stop-os-x-terminal-ssh-timeout/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Feb 2012 07:57:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://medoix.com/posts/2012/02/stop-os-x-terminal-ssh-timeout/</guid><description>There are three ways to do this using the ServerAliveInterval to send data along every few seconds. Replace the &amp;ldquo;10&amp;rdquo; with the number of seconds between pings.
From least to most global:
1. Add the option on the command line:
ssh -o ServerAliveInterval=10 keepsdroppingme.com 2. Add the option to your personal ssh config by creating/editing ~/.ssh/config:
# This is ~/.ssh/config # For all hosts ServerAliveInterval 10 # For a selection of hosts Host keepsdroppingme.</description></item><item><title>Tor Hidden Service on Ubuntu</title><link>https://medoix.com/posts/2012/01/tor-hidden-service-on-ubuntu/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jan 2012 20:45:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://medoix.com/posts/2012/01/tor-hidden-service-on-ubuntu/</guid><description>NOTE: This article does not explain how to setup apache or any other services apart from the tor application for hidden_service.
I have recently been migrating all of my browsing, email and communications etc through the Tor Network.
One of the cool features of the onion router is the ability to setup what is referred to as a hidden service. This is just what it sounds like, a domain (16characters.onion) randomly generated and completely anonymous through the Tor network can be configured to point to a local service port.</description></item><item><title>Enable VNC/Management on OSX by SSH</title><link>https://medoix.com/posts/2011/11/enable-vnc/management-on-osx-by-ssh/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Nov 2011 09:56:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://medoix.com/posts/2011/11/enable-vnc/management-on-osx-by-ssh/</guid><description>I had the VNC based remote access feature of OS X enabled on 10.7 but somehow it got switched off. I fiddled around a bit and figured out how to enable remote access from a remote SSH shell. Note that these instructions will lead to manual configuration and you will not be able to enable/disabled the services from the System Preferences anymore. In my case I used this to get in when I needed to but latter switched it back off and used the System Preferences setting.</description></item></channel></rss>
