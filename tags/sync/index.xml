(i am a time traveler). This usually screams out one thing.
Check the system time!
Upon checking my guest machines time it was in fact days behind where it should be, this meant that even with the VirtualBox guest tools installed AND the &amp;ldquo;Hardware clock in UTC&amp;rdquo; option selected under Motherboard, the guest was still not getting the right time.</description></item></channel></rss>
