I have recently been migrating all of my browsing, email and communications etc through the Tor Network.
One of the cool features of the onion router is the ability to setup what is referred to as a hidden service. This is just what it sounds like, a domain (16characters.onion) randomly generated and completely anonymous through the Tor network can be configured to point to a local service port.</description></item></channel></rss>
